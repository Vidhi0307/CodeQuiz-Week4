# CodeQuiz-Week4
# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz


## Description

This project is the solution for the Bootcamp week 4 Challenge .The objective was to create a quiz using javascript and web Api concepts.
-I have tried my best to create the quiz web applicatio using the HTML,css,javvascript and webAPI skills and knowledge that I gained in the first 4 weeks.
-The assignment was to create a timed quiz .For every incorrect answer 15 seconds will be deducted.Also player will be able to save and display his high scores.
-I am happy that I was able to actually apply the skills, it gave me more clarity and confidence about the knowledge.



## Installation

-A public link has been created for the website which requires any web browser.


## Usage

The code renders to a webpage with a start button for the code quiz.
-After starting the quiz user will be presented by series of random questions with four options to select from.
-A timer is implemented for timing the quiz.For every incorrect answer 15 secx will be deducted from the Timer.
-Once the user finishes with all the questions he/she will be taken to the score page where they can enter their name to be linked with the score.
-Once the score is registered to the name ,user will be taken to another webpage with all the high score till time and also with two buttons "Go back" (going back to the start page )and "clear scores" for clearing the local storage /the highscores list.
